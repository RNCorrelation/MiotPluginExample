<p>We may disclose your personal information to third-party service providers and affiliated companies as listed below. In each case described in this section, you can be assured that Lumi will only share your personal information in accordance with your consent.

Lumi may disclose your personal data to the Xiaomi or other Mi Ecosystem companies so as to provide you with and improve the exciting products and services (both hardware and software) from the Mi Ecosystem companies. Some of these products and services will still be under the Xiaomi / Mijia / Mitu brands, while others may use their own brand.

  <li>Your assistance will help us protect the privacy of your personal information.</li>
</ul>


<h4>RETENTION POLICY</h4>
<p>Personal information will be held for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws. We shall cease to retain personal information, or remove the means by which the personal information can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which that personal information was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal information, including the cases when the personal information is no longer required for resolving legal disputes, applying our Agreements, or achieving our business goals.</p>

<h4>ACCESSING OTHER FEATURES ON YOUR DEVICE</h4>
<p>Our applications may need access to certain features on your device such as Wi-Fi network status.

<h4>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</h4>
<p>You may withdraw your consent for the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal information in our possession or control by opening the app and navigating to Settings > Terms of Use and Privacy Policy > Revoke authorization for "Terms of Use and Privacy Policy". We will process your request within a reasonable time from when the request was made, and thereafter not collect, use and/or disclose your personal information as per your request.</p>
<p>Please recognize that your withdrawal of consent could result in certain legal consequences. Depending on the extent of your withdrawal of consent for us to process your personal information, it may mean that you will not be able to enjoy Lumi’s products and services.</p>

<h4>TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OUTSIDE OF YOUR JURISDICTION</h4>
<p>To the extent that we may need to transfer personal information outside of your jurisdiction, whether to our affiliated companies (which are in the communications, social media, technology and cloud businesses) or Third Party Service Providers, we shall do so in accordance with the applicable laws. In particular, we will ensure that all transfers will be in accordance with requirements under your applicable local data protection laws by putting in place appropriate safeguards.</p>
<p>Currently, Lumi has data centers in China, Singapore, Germany, and Russia. These overseas jurisdictions may or may not have in place data protection laws which are substantially similar to that in your home jurisdiction. We may transfer to and store your personal information at our overseas facilities. However, this does not change any of our commitments to safeguard your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
